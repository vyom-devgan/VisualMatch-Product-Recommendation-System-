# VisualMatch: Product Recommendation System Using Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)

**VisualMatch** is an advanced product recommendation system designed to retrieve and recommend products based on their visual features. Using **Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)** techniques, this system leverages deep learning models to extract feature vectors from product images and compute similarity using cosine similarity, resulting in highly relevant recommendations.

## Introduction
VisualMatch allows users to find visually similar products from a collection of images. This can be useful in various industries, such as e-commerce, where recommending products that visually resemble the one a customer is viewing can enhance the shopping experience.

The core of the system is a **ResNet18** deep learning model that has been pre-trained on ImageNet for feature extraction. By comparing feature vectors using **cosine similarity**, the system recommends the top visually similar products to the user.
